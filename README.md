# Turn Coordinator Simulator (Modern OpenGL)

This project is a turn coordinator simulator developed using Modern OpenGL. The turn coordinator is an aviation instrument used to monitor the horizontal axis (roll) movements of an aircraft and provide pilots with information about the flight attitude. It is designed particularly to indicate the aircraft's bank angles and rate of turn during turning maneuvers.

## Values Read From the Turn Coordinator
**Slip**: When the aircraft is making a turn, it slides towards the center. It occurs if the rotation movement is insufficient or the rotation speed is low.
(if the ball is sliding in the direction of aircraft's rotation.)

**Skid**: When the plane is making a turn, it slides out of the center. Rotation may occur if the movement is excessive or fast.
(if the ball is sliding in the opposite direction of the aircraft's rotation.)

**Coordinated Turn**: The aircraft performs its rotation smoothly and evenly. It moves evenly on both horizontal and vertical axes, there is no sliding or skidding.
(if the ball is in the middle during the turn.)

**Standard rate turn**: A standard rate turn is defined as a 3째 per second turn, which completes a 360째 turn in 2 minutes. This is known as a 2-minute turn, or rate one (180째/min).
(when the aircraft miniature indicator is exactly in line with the 'R' or 'L' marker)
